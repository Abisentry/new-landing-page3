        <p className="mt-4 text-lg lg:text-base xl:text-lg text-white">
        Abisentry Technologies leverages technology responsibly to provide the best experience for our users.

      <div className="text-4xl sm:text-6xl lg:text-5xl text-center mb-10">Scope of this Privacy Statement
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg lg:text-base xl:text-lg text-white"> As a technology company, we provide this Privacy Statement (which we’ll refer to as “Privacy Statement”) to explain how we and our related sites and applications collect, use, share, or otherwise process information when you interact with us and our offerings, services, and experiences or when businesses provide us with your information. From time to time, we may develop new Services. Unless stated otherwise, when we introduce these new or additional services, they will be subject to this Privacy Statement. This Privacy Statement applies to all Abisentry Technologies websites, applications, and offerings.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="text-4xl sm:text-6xl lg:text-5xl text-center mb-10">Our Role
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg lg:text-base xl:text-lg text-white" > Abisentry Technologies determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal information as described in this Privacy Statement and therefore acts as ‘data controller’ (or equivalent/similar terms) for purposes recognized by certain data privacy laws. We may share your personal information with partner companies and conduct processing activities as controllers or joint controllers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg lg:text-base xl:text-lg text-white">In certain circumstances, there may be more than one data controller processing your information. For example, a partner may also act as a data controller. In these situations, we act as an independent data controller over our processing activities, meaning that we make determinations over how your personal information will be processed independently from the other data controllers. The other data controllers have their own obligations under applicable information privacy laws. Abisentry Technologies is not responsible for the processing of other data controllers, and you should contact them directly for questions on how they process your personal information and for exercising your privacy rights in relation to such processing.
